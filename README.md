## Overview 🛠️

This Visual Studio Code extension provides comprehensive syntax highlighting for AMDGPU  assembly language for GCN/RDNA. It's designed to improve readability and understanding of assembly code, including compiler-generated output.

## Features ✨

- Syntax highlighting for AMDGPU assembly instructions 💻
- Support for Intel syntax 🧠
- Highlighting of registers, memory operands, and numeric constants 🔍
- Recognition of common assembler directives ⚙️
- Proper highlighting of labels and function names 🏷️
- Support for compiler-generated assembly features (e.g., CFI directives) 🛡️

## Installation 🚀

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for "Universal Assembly Syntax Highlighting"
4. Click Install

## Usage 💡

Once installed, the extension will automatically provide syntax highlighting for files with the following extensions:

- `.asm`
- `.s`
- `.S`
- `.nasm`
- `.asmx`
- `.inc`

If you're working with a file that has a different extension but contains x86/x64 assembly code, you can manually set the language mode:

1. Click on the language indicator in the bottom-right corner of VS Code
2. Select "x86/x64 Assembly" from the list of languages

## Highlighted Elements 🎨

This extension provides syntax highlighting for:

- Instructions (e.g., `mov`, `push`, `call`) 📝
- Registers (e.g., `eax`, `rbp`, `r15`) 📟
- Memory operands (e.g., `DWORD PTR`, `QWORD PTR`) 📋
- Numeric constants (decimal and hexadecimal) 🔢
- Labels and function names 🏷️
- Assembler directives (e.g., `.section`, `.globl`) 🧭
- CFI directives (e.g., `.cfi_startproc`, `.cfi_endproc`) 🛡️
- Comments (lines starting with `;`) 💬

## Customization 🎨

You can customize the colors used for syntax highlighting by modifying your VS Code color theme. Add or modify entries in your `settings.json` file under `"editor.tokenColorCustomizations"`.

For example:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
        {
            "scope": "keyword.control.instruction.amdgpu",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#C678DD"
            }
        },
        {
            "scope": "variable.language.register.amdgpu",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#E06C75"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
